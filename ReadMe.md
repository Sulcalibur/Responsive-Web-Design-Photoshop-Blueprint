#Responsive Design Photoshop Blueprint

---

The idea is simple. Any web developer that uses LESS or Sass/Sass or similar will know about the benefits of not having to repeat yourself and using mixins. This works almost the same in principal but from a graphical point of view. 

The idea is so similar that you can even use elements graphically similar to how you would use say a mixin from Twitter Bootstrap or Classy Sass Buttons from a Gem file. Responsive Web Design is all about using the same semantic design that adapts across various breakpoints(screen sizes). This approach is what is needed during the graphic stages also. 

Smart object and filters are almost ideal in Photoshop but are normally just for that one file, so having various files for different screen widths means this is not a versatile. Using an extension though called CanLinkit gives us the ability though to use consistent elements across the whole design and any changes that need to be made can be made from the one file and will generate across all sizes.

Because of this approach it means moving across to the coding is even more rapid as it is working with the same methodology.

I personally use Compass, SUSY and SCSS for my coding and this method is mainly used for this setup. It is flexible enough however to be moved across to Bootstrap, 320&up, Less, Scss or even just plain old vanilla CSS.



#####Update:

Ok, a complete change of direction from the last version. 

Instead of using one cluttered PSD file with all the elements and breakpoints I am now using separate files and using smart objects embedded into each document. The guides really work well with it this way also as it means there are not so many in the visual work area.

To make the work you will need a couple of amazing plugins for Photoshop.

To enable linking in smart objects to the various different documents (This **really** should be default Adobe) :
